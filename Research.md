## **Concepts About Voice:** ##
<br>
Two core speech technologies are supported through the Java Speech API: speech synthesis and speech recognition.<br>
<br>
<b>Speech synthesis:</b><br>

Speech synthesis provides the reverse process of producing synthetic speech from text generated by an application, an applet, or a user. It is often referred to as text-to-speech technology. <br>
The major steps in producing speech from text are as follows:<br>
•	Structure analysis: Processes the input text to determine where paragraphs, sentences, and other structures start and end. For most languages, punctuation and formatting data are used in this stage.<br>
•	Text pre-processing: Analyzes the input text for special constructs of the language. In English, special treatment is required for abbreviations, acronyms, dates, times, numbers, currency amounts, e-mail addresses, and many other forms. Other languages need special processing for these forms, and most languages have other specialized requirements.<br>
•	Text-to-phoneme conversion: Converts each word to phonemes. A phoneme is a basic unit of sound in a language.<br>
•	Prosody analysis: Processes the sentence structure, words, and phonemes to determine the appropriate prosody for the sentence.<br>
•	Waveform production: Uses the phonemes and prosody information to produce the audio waveform for each sentence.<br>

<b>Speech recognition:</b><br>

Speech recognition provides computers with the ability to listen to spoken language and determine what has been said. In other words, it processes audio input containing speech by converting it to text.<br>
The major steps of a typical speech recognizer are as follows:<br>
•	Grammar design: Defines the words that may be spoken by a user and the patterns in which they may be spoken.<br>
•	Signal processing: Analyzes the spectrum (i.e., the frequency) characteristics of the incoming audio.<br>
•	Phoneme recognition: Compares the spectrum patterns to the patterns of the phonemes of the language being recognized.<br>
•	Word recognition: Compares the sequence of likely phonemes against the words and patterns of words specified by the active grammars.<br>
•	Result generation: Provides the application with information about the words the recognizer has detected in the incoming audio.<br>
