Our project topic is about computer control with voice for Linux or Windows operating systems.We are probably going to use Java Programming Language to achieve our aim.We think that we make some operations like file manupulation ,writing something in text editor. Additionally, maybe we will add a function to authorize program with face recognition. We maybe also will make a little game to educate children by using voice.
