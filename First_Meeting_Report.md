----  Firstly , we had written our details of project , we talked about our system’s needs, requirements, what properties the project&system could have after that we found away of Project to be improved in future.  We tought that the the application that be used for disabled people. We made decision that this way will be efficient and useful for people. We tought that “Evolutionary Software Project Model” will fit on Project. Because when we start to implement Project requirements maybe changed after a while. That’s why we choose evolutionary model. We are going to use Java(JCreator,Eclipse) and maybe Matlab(R2013a) as a programming languages.  The working environment that we are going to implement our Project on Windows (and/or Linux). Firstly we will promote voice to computer.
