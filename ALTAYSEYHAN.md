I am senior student in Industrial Engineering department also I'm doing minor program in Computer Engineering Department. I'm living in Küçükyalı almost 22 years.I'm huge fan of rpg games such as Might and Magic,Elder Scroll series etc.Also i like to watch series,movies and anime's.<br>

If i had second chance i would probably select Computer Engineering as my major.
